# Gragh_RadioML2018.01A
## Dataset Description

This dataset is derived from **RadioML2018.01A** and introduces a novel method for constructing graph-domain structured data:

1. **Gradient-Based Structural Mapping**  
   Construct the graph topology based on gradient variations of signal time-domain features, preserving both local abrupt changes and global spatiotemporal trends.
2. **Graph Structure Transformation**  
   Convert raw signal samples into graph-structured data with **four-dimensional node features**, where each node represents a characteristic point of the signal.
3. **Edge Feature Computation**  
   Dynamically quantify the interaction strength between nodes using a **fuzzy data field force** model. This model integrates electromagnetic potential field functions with fuzzy logic, replacing the traditional binary adjacency matrix.
